# Eat-the-Burger

Full-stack application with handlebars

Problem: The owner of a burger restaraunt wants to create a record of customer's favorite burgers to determine the type of burgers he should cook.

Solution: Create a burger app that allows the customer to enter their favorite burger or select a burger from a pre-selected list. If the customer is likely to eat the burger they choose to devour it. All burgers along with the status of the burger are stored in the database.

Eat-the-Burger is a restaurant app that allows a user to enter burgers they'd like to eat and then click the "Submit" button to save the burger to the page and the database.

The new burger is identified with a unique ID, determined by the database.

New burgers "devoured" column defaults to 0 and appear in the burger list on the left as shown in the application.

Once the new burger is entered and the "Submit" button is clicked the burger is saved to the database and paired with a "Devour" button.

Click the "Devour button for any burger in the list. The burger is then placed in the  "Devoured Burgers List" on the right
and the "devoured" column is updated from 0 to 1.

The app is created by using MySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars.
